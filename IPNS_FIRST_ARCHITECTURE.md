## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **Before: Dual ID System (Confusing)**
```
Form Creation:
1. Generate formId: `form-${Date.now()}` (e.g., form-1761266261116)
2. Create IPNS name: k51qzi5uqu5dgmm05tos...
3. Register on blockchain: forms[formId] → Form{ipnsName, ...}
4. URL: /forms/form-1761266261116/edit

Problems:
❌ Two IDs per form (formId + IPNS)
❌ FormId is arbitrary timestamp
❌ IPNS stored but not used as primary key
❌ Confusing ID management
```

### **After: IPNS-First (Clean & Simple)**
```
Form Creation:
1. Create IPNS name: k51qzi5uqu5dgmm05tos... (this IS the ID!)
2. Register on blockchain: forms[ipnsName] → Form{...}
3. URL: /forms/k51qzi5uqu5dgmm05tos.../edit
4. Optional: Custom domain mapping for memorable URLs

Benefits:
✅ Single ID system (IPNS only)
✅ Content-addressable URLs
✅ No duplicate IDs to manage
✅ Simpler blockchain mapping
✅ Custom domains = monetization opportunity
✅ Keys always recoverable (encrypted on-chain)
```

## 📝 Smart Contract Changes

### New Contract: `FormRegistryIPNS.sol`

#### Key Struct (Simplified)
```solidity
struct Form {
    address creator;
    string encryptedKeyCID;    // No separate ipnsName field needed
    PrivacyMode privacyMode;
    uint256 createdAt;
    bool active;
    string customDomain;       // Optional custom domain
}

// Primary storage: IPNS → Form (no more formId!)
mapping(string => Form) public forms;

// Custom domain mapping (monetizable feature!)
mapping(string => string) public customDomains; // customId → ipnsName
```

#### New Functions for Custom Domains

**Register Custom Domain (Monetizable!)**
```solidity
function registerCustomDomain(
    string memory ipnsName,
    string memory customDomain
) external payable onlyFormCreator(ipnsName) {
    require(msg.value >= domainPrice, "Insufficient payment");
    // ...register custom domain...
}
```

**Release Custom Domain**
```solidity
function releaseCustomDomain(string memory ipnsName) 
    external onlyFormCreator(ipnsName);
```

**Resolve Domain to IPNS**
```solidity
function resolveToIPNS(string memory idOrDomain) 
    external view returns (string memory);
```

#### Updated Functions
- `registerForm()` - Now takes IPNS as primary param (no formId)
- `setFormStatus()` - Uses IPNS name parameter
- `updateEncryptedKey()` - Uses IPNS name parameter
- `getCreatorForms()` - Returns array of IPNS names

---

## 💻 Frontend Changes

### 1. Form Creation (`/pages/forms/create.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
const formId = `form-${Date.now()}`;
const { name, nameObj } = await createIPNSName();
// Two separate IDs to manage...
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Step 1: Create IPNS FIRST (this is our ID!)
const { name, nameObj } = await createIPNSName();
const formId = name; // Single ID system!

const formMetadata: FormMetadata = {
  id: formId, // Now using IPNS as the ID
  // ...
};
```

### 2. Blockchain Library (`/lib/ipns-restore.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
const formIds = await contract.getCreatorForms(walletAddress);
// Returns form-123456789...
```

**After:**
```typescript
const ipnsNames = await contract.getCreatorForms(walletAddress);
// Returns k51qzi5uqu5dgmm05tos... (IPNS names directly!)

const form = {
  formId: ipnsName, // formId IS the IPNS name
  ipnsName: ipnsName,
  // ...
};
```

### 3. Dashboard (`/pages/index.tsx`)

- Updated to use `FormRegistryIPNS.abi.json`
- Delete function now uses IPNS names for `setFormStatus()`
- Forms display with IPNS names in URLs

### 4. Edit Page (`/pages/forms/[id]/edit.tsx`)

- ✅ **No changes needed!** Already uses `[id]` dynamically
- Will work with IPNS names automatically
- Routes like `/forms/k51qzi5uqu5dgmm05tos.../edit` work out of the box

### 5. Backend API (`/pages/api/blockchain/register-form.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
await contract.registerForm(
  creatorAddress,
  formId,      // Timestamp-based
  ipnsName,    // Actual IPNS
  encryptedKeyCID,
  privacyModeEnum
);
```

**After:**
```typescript
await contract.registerForm(
  creatorAddress,
  ipnsName,         // IPNS is the primary ID
  encryptedKeyCID,
  privacyModeEnum
);
```

---

## 🎯 URL Structure

### Current URLs
```
Create:  /forms/create
List:    / (dashboard)
Edit:    /forms/k51qzi5uqu5dgmm05tos.../edit
View:    /forms/view/k51qzi5uqu5dgmm05tos...
```

### Future with Custom Domains
```
Edit (IPNS):   /forms/k51qzi5uqu5dgmm05tos.../edit
Edit (Custom): /forms/my-awesome-form/edit
View (IPNS):   /forms/view/k51qzi5uqu5dgmm05tos...
View (Custom): /forms/view/my-awesome-form
```

---

## 💰 Monetization Strategy: Custom Domains

### Problem
- IPNS names are long and unmemorable: `k51qzi5uqu5dgmm05tos...`
- Users want friendly URLs like `my-survey` or `feedback-2025`

### Solution: Custom Domain Registration

**Base Price:** 0.01 ETH per domain

**Benefits for Users:**
- Memorable URLs for sharing
- Professional branding
- Easy to remember and type
- Optional (IPNS still works for free)

**Benefits for Platform:**
- Revenue stream from domain registrations
- Premium feature differentiation
- Encourage professional usage

### Implementation
1. User creates form (free, uses IPNS)
2. User can optionally register custom domain (0.01 ETH)
3. Both URLs work: IPNS (permanent) and custom (transferable)
4. Contract owner can adjust pricing via `updateDomainPrice()`
5. Revenue withdrawable via `withdraw()` function

---

## 🔐 Security & Ownership

### Natural Ownership Control
- **IPNS Key = Editing Rights**
  - Only creator has IPNS private key
  - Cannot edit form without the key
  - Cryptographically enforced

### Multi-Device Access
- **Encrypted Backup System**
  - IPNS key encrypted with wallet signature
  - Uploaded to IPFS
  - CID stored on blockchain
  - Any device can restore with wallet signature

### Key Properties
1. User cannot lose access (encrypted backup on-chain)
2. Non-owners cannot edit (no IPNS key)
3. Works across all devices (restore from blockchain)
4. No centralized key management needed

## 📊 Comparison: Before vs After

| Aspect | Before (Dual ID) | After (IPNS-First) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **IDs per form** | 2 (formId + IPNS) | 1 (IPNS only) |
| **Contract key** | formId (timestamp) | ipnsName (content-addressable) |
| **URL structure** | /forms/form-123.../edit | /forms/k51qzi.../edit |
| **Custom domains** | Not supported | ✅ Built-in + monetizable |
| **ID management** | Complex mapping | Single source of truth |
| **Migration cost** | N/A | Zero (new architecture) |
| **Monetization** | None | Domain registration revenue |

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create form → Verify IPNS is used as ID
- [ ] View dashboard → Forms load from blockchain
- [ ] Click Edit → Auto-restore keys if needed
- [ ] Edit form → Save changes via IPNS
- [ ] Delete form → Blockchain transaction successful
- [ ] Clear browser data → Forms still load
- [ ] Multi-device → Test key restoration
- [ ] Custom domain → Register and resolve (future feature)

## 🎓 Key Insights from User

> "we can keep ipns names instead of the formid as we dont need to have two confusing IDs for a form"

> "if user looses ipns keys, he should loose access to edit the form. this is ok as they cant loose the keys as we are storing them encrypted onchain?"

> "but user can optionally add a custom domain to the form (which could be a formId) which maps to a ipns. this way people can optionally make rememberable form urls (and we can monetize this feature in the long run)"

**Result:** Implemented exactly as envisioned! 🎉
