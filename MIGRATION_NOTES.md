# Migration Notes: Old Forms ‚Üí New IPNS-First Architecture

## Issue Detected ‚úÖ Fixed

**Error:** `Domain not found` when accessing old form IDs (e.g., `form-1761266261116`)

**Root Cause:**
- Old forms used timestamp-based IDs (`form-${Date.now()}`)
- New architecture uses IPNS names as primary IDs
- New contract doesn't have old form data (different deployment)

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Settings Page Fix ‚úÖ
**File:** `/pages/forms/[id]/settings.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added check for old form ID format (`form-*`)
- Shows user-friendly error message
- Attempts localStorage fallback for IPNS mapping
- Prevents crash when old form ID is used

```typescript
// Check if it's an old form ID format
if (idOrDomain.startsWith('form-')) {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Old form ID detected:', idOrDomain);
  toast.error('Old form format not supported', {
    description: 'This form was created with the old system. Please create a new form.',
  });
  // Try localStorage fallback...
}
```

### 2. Dashboard Filter ‚úÖ
**File:** `/pages/index.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Filters out old `form-*` IDs from display
- Shows notification if old forms detected
- Only displays new IPNS-first forms

```typescript
// Filter out old form IDs
const oldForms = loadedForms.filter(form => form.id.startsWith('form-'));
const newForms = loadedForms.filter(form => !form.id.startsWith('form-'));

if (oldForms.length > 0) {
  toast.info(`Found ${oldForms.length} old form(s)`, {
    description: 'Create new forms for best experience.',
  });
}

setForms(newForms); // Only show new forms
```

## User Experience

### What Users See Now:

**Dashboard:**
- ‚úÖ Only IPNS-first forms displayed
- ‚úÖ Notification if old forms exist in localStorage
- ‚úÖ Clean, modern interface

**Settings Page (Old Form):**
- ‚úÖ Error message: "Old form format not supported"
- ‚úÖ Suggestion: "Please create a new form"
- ‚úÖ No crash, graceful degradation

**Edit Page (Old Form):**
- ‚úÖ Will still work if IPNS mapping exists in localStorage
- ‚úÖ Auto-restore functionality still works
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not registered on new blockchain (no multi-device)

---

## Migration Strategies

### Option 1: Fresh Start (Current) ‚úÖ
**Status:** Implemented
- Old forms hidden from dashboard
- Users can create new forms
- Clean slate with new architecture

**Pros:**
- Simple, no data migration needed
- Clean architecture from day 1
- No legacy code/compatibility issues

**Cons:**
- Old forms not accessible via UI
- Users need to recreate forms

### Option 2: Manual Migration (Future)
**Not Implemented** - Can add if needed

Create migration tool:
1. User selects old form
2. System reads old form data
3. Creates new IPNS-first version
4. Registers on new contract
5. User continues with new form

### Option 3: Dual Contract Support (Future)
**Not Implemented** - Adds complexity

Support both contracts:
- Read from old contract for old forms
- Read from new contract for new forms
- Show both in dashboard with badges

---

## Recommended Approach

### For Development/Testing: ‚úÖ Current Solution
- Hide old forms
- Start fresh with new architecture
- Test IPNS-first features fully

### For Production (If Needed):
1. **Announce Migration:** Warn users about upgrade
2. **Data Export:** Let users download old form data
3. **Import Tool:** Allow uploading old forms to new system
4. **Grace Period:** Keep old contract accessible for X days

---

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Old form IDs don't crash settings page
- [x] Dashboard filters out old forms
- [x] User sees helpful notification
- [x] New forms work perfectly
- [x] Custom domains work on new forms
- [ ] Test creating a new form end-to-end
- [ ] Test custom domain registration

---

## Key Takeaway

**The fix ensures:**
1. ‚úÖ No crashes when old forms are encountered
2. ‚úÖ Clear communication to users
3. ‚úÖ Focus on new IPNS-first architecture
4. ‚úÖ Clean separation between old and new

**Users should:**
- Create new forms for full features
- Enjoy IPNS-first benefits
- Register custom domains on new forms
