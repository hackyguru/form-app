# View Responses Feature - Access Points

## Summary

Added easy access points for form creators to view responses to their forms.

## Changes Made

### 1. Settings Page - "View Responses" Button

**File:** `/pages/forms/[id]/settings.tsx`

**Added:** New card section with "View Responses" button

**Location:** Between IPNS Address card and Custom Domain Manager

**Button action:** Navigates to `/forms/[ipns]/responses`

```tsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <Shield className="h-5 w-5" />
      Form Responses
    </CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>
      View and manage responses submitted to your form
    </CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <Button
      onClick={() => router.push(`/forms/${resolvedIPNS}/responses`)}
      className="w-full"
    >
      View Responses
      <ExternalLink className="ml-2 h-4 w-4" />
    </Button>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### 2. Dashboard - "View Responses" Menu Item

**File:** `/pages/index.tsx`

**Added:** New menu item in the form card dropdown menu

**Location:** First item in the dropdown (before "Duplicate" and "Delete")

**Button action:** Navigates to `/forms/[ipns]/responses`

```tsx
<DropdownMenuItem 
  onClick={() => router.push(`/forms/${form.id}/responses`)}
>
  <BarChart className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  View Responses
</DropdownMenuItem>
```

**Also added:** 
- `import { useRouter } from "next/router"`
- `const router = useRouter()` hook in component

## User Flow

### From Dashboard

1. User sees their forms on the dashboard
2. Clicks the three-dot menu (⋮) on any form card
3. Sees "View Responses" as the first option
4. Clicks → Redirects to `/forms/[ipns]/responses`

### From Settings Page

1. User navigates to form settings via dashboard
2. Scrolls down to see "Form Responses" card
3. Clicks "View Responses" button
4. Redirects to `/forms/[ipns]/responses`

## Response Page Features

Once on the responses page, form creators can:

- ✅ View list of all responses
- ✅ See submission timestamps
- ✅ See submitter addresses (or "Anonymous")
- ✅ Load response data from IPFS on demand
- ✅ View full response details in a dialog
- ✅ Export all responses to CSV
- ✅ Filter responses by date
- ✅ Search responses by content

## Access Control

The responses page (`/pages/forms/[id]/responses.tsx`) already has built-in access control:

```typescript
// Check if user is form owner
const isOwner = await contract.isFormCreator(formId, walletAddress);
setIsFormOwner(isOwner);

if (!isOwner) {
  toast.error('Only form owner can view responses');
  router.push('/');
  return;
}
```

Only the wallet address that created the form can view its responses.

## UI/UX Improvements

1. **Prominent Access Points:** Two ways to access responses (dashboard & settings)
2. **Clear Labels:** "View Responses" with chart icon
3. **Consistent Placement:** Logical location in both contexts
4. **No Authentication Required:** Automatically checks if user is form owner

## Testing

### Test on Dashboard

1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Connect wallet
3. Find any form you created
4. Click the three-dot menu (⋮)
5. Click "View Responses"
6. Should navigate to responses page

### Test on Settings

1. Visit a form's settings page
2. Scroll down to "Form Responses" section
3. Click "View Responses" button
4. Should navigate to responses page

## Icons Used
