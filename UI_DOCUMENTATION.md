```

## 🎨 Color Scheme

The app uses a sophisticated color palette with CSS variables for easy theming:
- **Primary**: Blue (#3b82f6) - Trust and security
- **Secondary**: Slate - Professional and clean
- **Accent colors** for states (success, warning, destructive)
- Full dark mode support

## 📝 Mock Data

All pages currently display mock/dummy data:
- 3 sample forms on the dashboard
- 4 sample responses in the responses page
- Pre-filled form fields in edit mode

## ⚡ Next Steps

The UI is complete and ready for backend integration. You can now:
1. Add state management (React Context, Zustand, or Redux)
2. Integrate with blockchain/IPFS for decentralized storage
3. Implement end-to-end encryption
4. Add form builder drag-and-drop functionality
5. Connect to Web3 wallets for authentication
6. Implement real-time response updates
7. Add analytics and insights

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

This UI was built with the following principles:
- **Privacy First**: Constant reminders of encryption and security
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive navigation and clear actions
- **Professional**: Clean, modern design suitable for business use
- **Accessible**: Using shadcn/ui components built with accessibility in mind
- **Responsive**: Works beautifully on all screen sizes

**Note**: This is a UI-only implementation. No functionality has been added yet - all buttons, forms, and interactions are visual representations waiting for backend logic.
