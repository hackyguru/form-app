## ðŸ”¬ Quick Test Plan

### 1. Create Form with IPNS ID âœ…
```bash
Expected: Form uses k51qzi5uqu... as ID (not form-123...)
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Create New Form"
3. Fill details and save
4. **Check console:** `âœ… IPNS name created (this is our form ID): k51qzi5uqu...`

### 2. Dashboard Loads IPNS Names âœ…
```bash
Expected: Forms loaded from blockchain with IPNS names
```
1. Reload homepage
2. **Check console:** `âœ… Found X form IPNS names from contract`
3. Forms display with IPNS IDs

### 3. Edit with IPNS URL âœ…
```bash
Expected: /forms/k51qzi5uqu.../edit
```
1. Click Edit on a form
2. URL contains IPNS name
3. Auto-restores keys if needed

### 4. Delete via Blockchain âœ…
