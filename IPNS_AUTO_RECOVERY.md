# 🔄 IPNS Auto-Recovery & Status Indicators

## What's New

### 1. 🆕 **Automatic IPNS Recreation**
When editing a form that has an IPNS name but missing signing key, the system now **automatically creates a new IPNS** instead of showing an error!

#### Before
```
Edit form → Missing key → ❌ Error: "IPNS signing key not found"
Form saved with new CID only (no permanent link)
```

#### After
```
Edit form → Missing key → 🔄 Auto-recreate IPNS!
Creates NEW permanent link with fresh signing key
✅ Form updated with NEW permanent IPNS address
```

---

### 2. 🏷️ **IPNS Status Badges**
Dashboard now shows visual indicators for each form's IPNS status!

#### Badge Types

**🔵 IPNS Badge (Blue)**
- Indicates: Full IPNS with valid signing key
- Means: Form can be updated via permanent link
- Tooltip: "Updateable permanent link (IPNS)"
- Action: Edit form → IPNS updates automatically

**🟠 IPNS⚠ Badge (Orange)**  
- Indicates: IPNS name exists but signing key missing
- Means: Can't update IPNS (yet)
- Tooltip: "IPNS link exists but signing key missing (will be recreated on edit)"
- Action: Edit form → New IPNS will be created automatically

**No Badge**
- Indicates: No IPNS setup
- Means: Old form or CID-only
- Action: Edit form → New IPNS will be created automatically

---

## How It Works

### Scenario 1: Edit Form with Valid IPNS ✅
```typescript
1. Check IPNS name → Found ✅
2. Check signing key → Found ✅
3. Upload form to IPFS → Get new CID
4. Update IPNS → Point to new CID
5. ✅ Success! Same permanent link, new content
```

**User sees:**
```
🔄 "Updating IPNS..."
✅ "Form updated successfully!"
   "Your permanent link now shows the updated form!"
```

---

### Scenario 2: Edit Form with Missing Key 🔄
```typescript
1. Check IPNS name → Found ✅
2. Check signing key → Not found ❌
3. Upload form to IPFS → Get new CID
4. Auto-create NEW IPNS name → Get k51...
5. Publish CID to new IPNS
6. Save new key and mapping
7. ✅ Success! New permanent link created
```

**User sees:**
```
🔄 "Recreating IPNS with new key..."
✅ "Form updated with NEW permanent link!"
   "New IPNS: k51qzi... (old link won't update anymore)"
```

**Note:** Old IPNS link becomes read-only (can't update without key)

---

### Scenario 3: Edit Old Form (No IPNS) 🆕
```typescript
1. Check IPNS name → Not found ❌
2. Upload form to IPFS → Get new CID
3. Auto-create NEW IPNS name → Get k51...
4. Publish CID to IPNS
5. Save key and mapping
6. ✅ Success! Permanent link created
```

**User sees:**
```
🔄 "Creating permanent IPNS link..."
✅ "Form updated with permanent link!"
   "Your form now has a permanent IPNS address: k51qzi..."
```

- Improved error messages
- Added graceful fallbacks
- Better toast notifications

**New imports:**
```typescript
import { 
  createIPNSName,      // Create new IPNS
  publishToIPNS,       // Publish to IPNS
  saveIPNSKey,         // Save signing key

} from "@/lib/ipns";
```

---

### `/pages/index.tsx` (Dashboard)
**Changes:**

- Shows visual indicators for IPNS health
- Hover tooltips for explanation
- Real-time status checking

**New features:**
```typescript
// Check IPNS status
const getIPNSStatus = async (formId: string) => {
  const ipnsName = getIPNSName(formId);
  if (!ipnsName) return 'none';
  
  const nameObj = await getIPNSNameObject(formId);
  return nameObj ? 'full' : 'partial';
};

// Status types:
// 'full'    → Has name + key (fully updateable)
// 'partial' → Has name, no key (needs recreation)  
// 'none'    → No IPNS at all (will be created)
```

```

## What This Solves

### Problem: User Report
> "IPNS signing key not found. Form saved with new CID."

### Root Cause
- Form has IPNS name in mapping
- But signing key missing from localStorage
- Could happen from:
  - Cleared browser data
  - Different device/browser
  - Key save failure
  - Manual deletion

### Solution Implemented
1. **Detect the issue** → Check for name without key
2. **Auto-recover** → Create new IPNS with new key
3. **Inform user** → Clear message about what happened
4. **Update mapping** → Save new IPNS name and key
5. **Continue working** → Form fully functional again

### Result
✅ User never stuck
✅ Form always accessible
✅ Permanent links always available
✅ Clear communication
